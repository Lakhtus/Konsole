Perfect! That gives me a much clearer picture of your project’s *identity*. It’s not just “Game of Life in a console” anymore — it’s more like a **mini educational rendering & simulation sandbox** in C++ where you’re experimenting with rasterization, 2D/3D graphics fundamentals, and simulation frameworks.

Here’s a **revamped, exciting README** draft tailored to your vision:

# 🖥️ Konsole – An Educational C++ Rendering & Simulation Sandbox

**Konsole** is a tiny but ambitious project where I explore the **fundamentals of computer graphics and simulations** from scratch.
Think of it as my personal playground for implementing:

* 🖊️ Rasterization algorithms (lines, triangles, filled shapes)
* 🎨 Flood fill and region-based algorithms
* 🧩 Grid-based simulations with ticks & speeds
* 🎲 An extendable `ISimulation` OOP interface for experiments
* 🌌 Future goal: **basic 3D rendering** 🚀

It’s not a full-fledged engine (yet). It’s more of an **educational lab** where I break down graphics & simulation concepts into code.

---

## ✨ Current & Planned Features

* ✅ Line rasterization (various algorithms like DDA, Bresenham)
* ✅ Basic triangle drawing & filled shapes
* ⏳ Flood filling (in progress)
* ⏳ Simulation system with adjustable speed/ticks
* ⏳ OOP interface for simulations (`ISimulation`)
* ⏳ Experiments with 3D rendering pipeline (planned)

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* C++17 compiler (g++, clang++, or MSVC)
* `make` (GNU Make or compatible)
* `git` (to clone the repo)

### Build & Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Konsole.git
cd Konsole
make
bin/release/main.exe   # or bin/debug/main.exe
```

---

## 🕹️ Usage

* Code lives in `src/`.
* Tweak algorithms, add new rasterization methods, or build your own simulations.
* Rebuild with `make`.
* Watch pixels & cells come to life!

---

## 🎯 Why This Exists

This project is **for learning**:

* How graphics are drawn at the pixel level.
* How simulations can be structured with OOP.
* How to evolve a tiny 2D rasterizer into a baby 3D renderer.

If you’re curious about computer graphics, this repo is meant to be hacked, broken, and experimented with.

💡 *Most features are not implemented yet — that’s the fun part. It’s a journey, not a finished engine.*

Would you like me to add a **roadmap section** with checkboxes (like a progress tracker: \[ ] flood fill, \[ ] 3D pipeline, \[ ] lighting, etc.) so readers can see what’s coming and you can track progress?
